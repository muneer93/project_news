      "and the White House has not been able to\n",
      "make any sort of influence or headway in\n",
      "with the Israeli government with respect\n",

      "Kimberly, this is Darina. I've taken\n",

      "him on this trip and talk us through\n",
      "what we expect to see over the next few\n",
      "hours while he's in Saudi Arabia.\n",
      "Yeah. What we know is that there is\n",
      "going to be a large delegation that will\n",
      "be traveling with the president. We know\n",
      "that the defense secretary Pete Hedgeth\n",
      "will be accompanying the president. Uh\n",
      "that is understandable given the\n",
      "enormous security spending defense\n",
      "contracts that are expected to take\n",
      "place. That is a primary goal of this\n",
      "trip. So the defense secretary peach\n",
      "heads as well given the fact that there\n",
      "are big regional security concerns. Iran\n",
      "is another big discussion point that\n",
      "will be taking place. The fact that in\n",
      "uh that Marco Rubio, the secretary of\n",
      "state, also the national security\n",
      "adviser, is on board the airplane, Air\n",
      "Force One, he is also here. Uh that is\n",
      "an important point to make here. This\n",
      "trip versus uh the first time Donald\n",
      "Trump was in his first term. Iran and\n",
      "the role that Saudi Arabia plays with\n",
      "respect to Iran is very different this\n",
      "time around. When uh the United States\n",
      "came to discuss Iran in Donald Trump's\n",
      "first term, it was about talking to\n",
      "Saudi Arabia and trying to isolate Iran\n",
      "to try and deal with what it saw as an\n",
      "extremist element. This time around,\n",
      "it's about trying to work with Iran,\n",
      "trying to uh to limit its nuclear\n",
      "program and even discuss the potential\n",
      "for a civil nuclear program. It's a very\n",
      "different tone. That is why the\n",
      "secretary of state is so instrumental\n",
      "this time around. We also know that uh\n",
      "there is a big business aspect. So there\n",
      "are key business leaders traveling with\n",
      "the US president as well. So there is an\n",
      "enormous delegation but it's very key\n",
      "that those players are alongside the\n",
      "president as he is preparing to exit Air\n",
      "Force One. Okay, Kimberly, we'll cross\n",
      "back to you uh shortly. I'm going to\n",
      "bring in Hashim Abb right now who's also\n",
      "joining us from Riyad. And we're keeping\n",
      "that live picture. We wait for Donald\n",
      "Trump to exit Air Force One any moment\n",
      "now. But Hashim, um, let's bring you in\n",
      "because look, in March, Trump said this.\n",
      "He said he'd go to Saudi Arabia if it\n",
      "invests $1 trillion in the US. Now, the\n",
      "Saudis haven't confirmed that figure,\n",
      "but what are the Saudis looking to get\n",
      "from the US?\n",
      "Well, it's is going to be mainly about\n",
      "trade agreements, major trade\n",
      "agreements. How much are they going to\n",
      "commit over the la upcoming years? That\n",
      "remains to be seen. But we're talking\n",
      "about\n",
      "potentially hundreds of billions of\n",
      "dollars of arms agreement providing the\n",
      "Saudis with new military capabilities.\n",
      "And uh one of the agreements is going to\n",
      "be about uh air-to-air missiles which\n",
      "are going to be equipped for the Saudi\n",
      "fighter jets. But then the the major\n",

      "dinner. But throughout the day, this is\n",
      "where they're going to also talk about\n",
      "all the other key regional play uh key\n",
